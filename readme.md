- Multiple-Projector Spherical Screen Calibration: this approach calibrates a multi-projector spherical screen. It recovers the geometry information (3d coordinates) of each pixel on the screen and computes the blending information (alpha mask) which adjusts the intensity of overlapping area for adjacent projectors. The result can be used to render wall-papered content on the surface and 3D content in the sphere ([video](https://youtu.be/KVKyXYCttfA)).
